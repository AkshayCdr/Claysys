        <h2>What we do</h2>

        <h3>The Work We Do</h3>
        <p>ClaySys, as a technology consulting service provider, 
            specializes in delivering IT solutions that make a positive 
            impact on businesses. Our focus is not only on a successful 
            technical implementation, but we are mindful of the business 
            impact all through the project, to ensure we mould and tune 
            the implementation to stay aligned with the key business objectives 
            at all times. We work with a wide portfolio of technologies and products,
             to enable us to deliver real value to our customers and to provide consulting
              services to our customers with their existing investments in their technology
               platforms. If you have a defined requirement, our technology consultants would
                be able to plan, design and develop your custom solution,
                 in most cases based on a fixed price engagement. 
                 The ability to engage on a fixed price basis is
                  dependent on the client's solution requirements 
                  being defined in enough detail. We also have an 
                  option to support a client to initially create and 
                  finalize the requirements and design, at which point 
                  we could transition to a fixed price engagement for the 
                  development and final deliverable phase.</p>



        <h3>Why We Are Different</h3>

        <p>ClaySys has always focused on a partnership model and 
            building long term relationships with our clients. 
            So our focus is always the best interests of our clients,
             versus just a specific technology project. We believe in retaining
             key employees, as that ensures continuity of quality support to our clients,
              without the disruption associated with a constant churn and attrition with employees.
               Since we are a software product company as well, 
               we try to adhere to the highest standards in terms of 
               technology architecture, patterns, security practices, 
               and solution scalability and maintainability.</p>
